DeweyStrontium
==============

This is a game engine in development using SFML.

This is the plan:

	1) Build an actual game
	2) Find a way to make everything more generic and absract so it can be re-used.
	3) We have a game engine!

To build you own version, utilize the Visual Studio C++ 2010 IDE.

When cloning the repo, make sure it is cloned in a folder named exactly "DeweyStrontium", and place the folder into your drive C:// for everything to work correctly. 

If you want to place it else where change the linker settings.
